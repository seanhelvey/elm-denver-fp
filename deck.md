# Who are we targeting?

![inline center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanhelvey/elm-denver-fp/master/img/target.png)

^ Notes

---

# Who else?

- Also Ruby, Python, Java, etc. Even Go!
- Would you rather someone use React, Vue, or Elm?
- Using Elm leads people down the path of PureScript, Reason, Haskell..

^ Notes

---

# It isn't that we don't care about Haskell

- It is about potential.
- Let's teach people how to be better programmers.
- Elm can help convert mainstream developers.
